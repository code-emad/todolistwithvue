# Todo list web app created with Vue.js

## Purpose
The goal of this project was for me to learn how to use Vue.js. In order to do this, I created a simple todo list wep application that uses local storage to store data.

## Functionality
The user can input text in the input field, select a category (work or personal) and then click the 'add to list' button to add the task to the list. Once added, users can click on the checkbox next to the task to strike through the item. The user can also click on the delete button to get rid of the task from the list. 

## Setup
In order to make a local clone of this project, within your terminal you will need to run 'git clone https://github.com/code-emad/todolistwithvue.git'

Once the files have been cloned, you will need change directory into the project directory and run `npm install` which will install the dependencies listed within the package.json file. 

## Minimum Versions
Node v18.12.0
